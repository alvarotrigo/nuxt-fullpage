## License

### Commercial license
If you want to use fullPage to develop nonopen sourced sites, themes, projects, and applications, the Commercial license is the appropriate license. With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. This means, you won't have to change your whole application source code to an open-source license. [[Purchase a Fullpage Commercial License]](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/pricing/)

### Open source license
If you are creating an open-source application under a license compatible with the [GNU GPL license v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), you may use fullPage under the terms of the GPLv3.

**You will have to provide a prominent notice that fullPage.js is in use. The credit comments in the JavaScript and CSS files should be kept intact** (even after combination or minification).
